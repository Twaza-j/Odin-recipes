    <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes 
            to sour the milk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong>
            Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add 
            flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter 
            will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 4</strong>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step 5</strong>
            Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear 
            on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on 
            the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.
