# Odine-recipes.

This is a basic recipe website project. 
I am  currently learning front end development under The Odin Project and this particular assignment is focussed on practicing 
all the HTML knowledge I have acquired.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links
to a few recipes. This is totally a learning project that will be developed
gradually.

Corrections and suggestions are welcome.
